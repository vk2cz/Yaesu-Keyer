# Yaesu-Keyer
Morse code key for Yaesu FT-901 &amp; FT-902

## Background
The Yaesu FT902 CW Keyer was on option on these radios back in the early 1980's, and very few radios were optioned back in the day. Of course the original CW keyer option is long obsolete,  and the Curtis 8044 key chip was a limited run, ceasing production just prior to Curttis death around 1995.  The project arose out of a radio restoration project where this was pretty much the only missing option.  My intent to make this old radio relevant in 2021 mean't the keyer was needed, along with the general restoration activites of metalwork refinishing, capacitor and LED replacement.

## Implementation
With the proliferation of PIC's since the BS-2 in 1995, there were lots of examples of PIC implementations of iambic keyers, many using techniques and attributes that kind of worked, but inflexible with the FT902 variable CW Speed control.
